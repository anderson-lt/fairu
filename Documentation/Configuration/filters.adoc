The instruction: `Name: ["Gopher", "home/blue"]` matches with:

* `Gopher`                   -> `Gopher`
* `home/blue`                -> `home/blue`
* `hello/Gopher`             -> `Gopher`
* `home/blue/Gopher`         -> `Gopher`
* `chroot/environ/home/blue` -> `home/blue`

But, not with:

* `MyGopher`
* `home/blue/color`
* `home/color/blue`
* `Gopher/Blue`
* `pher/home/blu`
